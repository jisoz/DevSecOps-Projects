# Global rate limiting plugin

#Rate limiting is a control mechanism used in APIs 
#(and web services in general) to limit the number of requests a
# client can make within a certain period of time. This is extremely important in
# fintech or any high-traffic application to prevent abuse, overload, or accidental crashes.

plugins:
  - name: rate-limiting
    config:
      minute: 300   #A client can make up to 300 requests per minute.
      hour: 10000 # And up to 10,000 requests per hour.
      policy: local #Rate limiting is enforced locally in the Kong instance, not shared globally.
      fault_tolerant: true #If the plugin fails, it won’t block requests (safer for production).
